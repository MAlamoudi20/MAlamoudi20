Hi there 👋

#### What am I interested in learning?

I want to learn more about the control systems that work on fighter jet airplanes. To be more specific, I want to understand the level of depth of those contorl systems in the F-22 Raptor. It is probably one my all time favorites and the sheer engineering skills to make one of those planes astonshes me.

#### What do I have going for me now?

Well I am a senior thats expected to graduate soon however, I do have a bucket list I want to do before leaving the country.

* Sky dive in California 🪂
* Go scuba diving in Hawaii 🤿
* Visit New York and Chicago 🏙️🌆
* Go on a hike in the Grand Canyons 🥾

#### Things I like to do during my free time:
* Build gundam models, preferbly the 1/100 scale.
* Stay in and binge shows with friends.
* Cook (I think im alright).
* Be active, I love doing boxing drills in the morning.
