### Hi there 👋



#### What do I have going for me now? Well I am a senior thats expected to graduate soon however, I do have a bucket list I want to do before leaving the country.

* Sky dive in California 🪂
* Go scuba diving in Hawaii 🤿

* Go on a hike in the Grand Canyons 🥾

#### Things I like to do during my free time:

* Build gundam models, preferbly the 1/100 scale.
* Stay in and binge shows with friends.
* Cook (I think im alright).
* Be active, I love doing boxing drills in the morning.
